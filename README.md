# JsTweetsApi

## SERVER:
Build a server with the following features:
- Connect to the Twitter API and save in a DB every time a new tweet with the word "javascript" in the body is generated.
- Expose an API so a client can get all the stored tweets. It must be possible to filter the tweets by username, hashtag
and user mention. A pagination feature is also required, giving the possibility to query 30, 50 and 100 tweets in the same
query.
- Use GitHub to store and version your code
